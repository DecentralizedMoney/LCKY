## Security Measures

### Smart Contracts (Ethereum)

1. **OpenZeppelin Libraries**
   - Battle-tested, audited contracts
   - Regular security updates

2. **Access Control**
   - Owner-only functions
   - Role-based permissions
   - Multisig recommended

3. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - ReentrancyGuard on critical functions
   - Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern

4. **Integer Overflow Protection**
   - Solidity 0.8+ built-in protection
   - SafeMath for additional safety

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Claim cooldown periods
   - Prevents spam attacks

6. **Supply Cap**
   - Maximum supply enforced
   - Prevents inflation attacks

7. **Emergency Features**
   - Pause mechanism
   - Emergency withdrawal (owner)
   - Circuit breakers

### Canisters (ICP)

1. **Access Control**
   - Caller verification
   - Controller permissions

2. **Stable Storage**
   - Persistent state
   - Upgrade safety

3. **Cycles Management**
   - Monitor cycle balance
   - Prevent out-of-cycles shutdown

4. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Bounds checking

## Audit Status

### Ethereum Contracts

- [ ] Internal audit: Pending
- [ ] External audit: Planned
- [ ] Bug bounty: To be launched

### ICP Canisters

- [ ] Internal review: Pending
- [ ] External audit: Planned

## Known Issues

## Best Practices for Users

### Wallet Security

1. **Use Hardware Wallets**
   - Ledger, Trezor recommended
   - Extra layer of security

2. **Verify Contracts**
   - Check contract address
   - Verify on Etherscan/explorer

3. **Beware of Phishing**
   - Double-check URLs
   - Never share private keys
   - Verify transaction details

4. **Test with Small Amounts**
   - Start with small transactions
   - Verify functionality

### Smart Contract Interaction

1. **Set Gas Limits**
   - Prevent excessive gas usage
   - Use recommended values

2. **Check Allowances**
   - Review token approvals
   - Revoke unnecessary permissions

3. **Verify Recipients**
   - Double-check addresses
   - Use ENS when possible

## Emergency Procedures

### If You Suspect a Security Issue

1. **Stop Using** affected features immediately
